#                                    scripts
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->
My personal collection of bash scripts. Some are actually useful ;)

Note that some snippets (or whole scripts) might be from third parties.
I collected them over many years from forums, wikis, and chats.
The original authors, if known, are referenced within the individual scripts,
If you recognize a script segment as your own (or know the author) and the file
has no reference or it is wrong, kindly let me know.
